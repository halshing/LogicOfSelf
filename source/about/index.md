# About This Blog

This blog is all about understanding yourself through your own truths. I am obsessed with figuring out how to have a good life. And life, as it turns out, isn't as simple, easy, and romantic as once expected. And to my complete and utter shock, I can't control everything about the world (who knew!) :( But what I know I can control is me and how I interact with the world. I believe this interaction is where our truths live. My mission is to explore my truths and better understand them and how I can live a good life.
